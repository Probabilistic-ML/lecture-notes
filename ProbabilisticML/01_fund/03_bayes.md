# Bayesian Inference, MLE & MAP

In the following sections, we explain the concepts of Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the maximum a-posteriori method (MAP). 

Bayesian inference uses {ref}```Bayes theorem<thm:bt>``` to update the probabilities as more data/evidence is available.

In many applications, it is not possible to perform full Bayesian inference, since the required terms can not be computed explicitly. To overcome this problem, MLE and MAP are useful tools in many cases.

As an introduction, we discuss the coin toss example in detail. In particular, the difference between the Bayesian and the frequentists approach is illustrated.
