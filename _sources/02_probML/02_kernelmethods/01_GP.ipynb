    "A Gaussian proccess is a paricular type of stochastic process. *But what do we understand by a stochastic process?* Typically, a stochastic process denotes a collection of random variables with a time dependence. Hence, the term *stochastic* is justified by the consideration of *random variables* and *process* relates to the *time dependence*. \n",
    "We state the following brief definition:\n",

    "```{admonition} Definition\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    ":name: def:tsp\n",
    "A **(temporal) stochastic process** is a collection of $\\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variables $(X_t)_{t \\in \\mathcal{I}}$, where either $\\mathcal{I} = \\mathbb{N}$ (discrete-time) or $\\mathcal{I} = \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$ (continuous-time).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, this kind of stochastic process describes the temporal process of random events. In this context, it makes sense to say that the outcome of $X_s$ happended before $X_t$ for $s < t$. Keep in mind that each random variable $X_t$ is a map $X_t: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $X_t(\\omega)$ for $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ is the outcome of a random experiment. The use of a stochastic process makes it possible to consider the outcomes of all random variables simultaneously. In this way, a so-called **sample path** or **random path** $(X_t(\\omega))_{t \\in \\mathcal{I}}$ is obtained. The shape of these paths depend strongly on the underlying properties of the stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very famous example is **Brownian motion** or **Wiener process** which has numerous applications in physics, finance, biology and many other areas. For example, the movement of a large particle (like pollen) due to collisions with small particles (like water molecules). A nice simulation can be found on the website of Andrew Duffy at Boston University (please click on the image to follow the link):\n",

For our machine learning applications we are interested in general inputs $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and outputs $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. In other words, a time-index is to restrictive and therefore, we generalize the idea to general index sets.

    "In {ref}```def:multnormal```, we have seen that a multivariate normal distribution is uniquely characterized by its mean $\\mu$ and covariance $\\Sigma$. A Gaussian process is an infinite-dimensional analogue if the index set is infinite. Indeed, we can select an arbitrary number of $x_i$ values and consider the corresponding multivariate normal distribution of arbitrary dimension. It turns out that **a Gaussian process is also specified by its mean and covariance, but they are functions instead of a vector and a matrix**. More precisely, the **mean** is a function\n",

The main observation is that the fixed value has no impact on the other component if the correlation is zero. In this case, the two components are independent. Moreover, the impact increases as the absolute value of the correlation increases.
